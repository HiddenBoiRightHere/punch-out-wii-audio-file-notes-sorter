# punch-out-wii-audio-file-notes-sorter
Uses the developer notes left behind containing audio file names and locations to help sort audio file names per type and/or character. Intended just to help sort through the audio data rather than have to open every single file to find what is wanted. 

Mainly just using this to keep up on my programming skills and show how I've improved since taking my programming class. 

## Important To Know
- Make sure the original .wav files have been renamed to .wem files, and that they are in the same directory as the text files! 
- Individual .bnk tracks can't be played by themselves. 
- If you get stuck in a loop, just restart the program and it will ask for a new directory. If that doesn't work, you can change it in the text file.
