# punch-out-wii-audio-file-notes-sorter
Uses the developer notes left behind containing audio file names and locations to help sort audio file names per type and/or character. Intended just to help sort through the audio data rather than have to open every single file to find what is wanted. 

Mainly just using this to keep up on my programming skills and show how I've improved since taking my programming class.
